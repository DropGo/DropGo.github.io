    	<h1>Welcome to my page about my schooling!</h1>
    	<h2>On this page I will describe my school experiences, extracurricular activities, and goals</h2>
    	<p>I will begin this page with speaking about the various institutions in which I've spent my time.</p>
    	<h2>Experiences</h2>
		<p>The schools at which I attended:</p>
		<dl class="margins-removed">
			<dt>Interlachen Elementary</dt>
			<dd>We were the fighting rams. I was in the gifted program here, as well as the engineering club, and the math all stars. Unfortunately I was never a safety patrol.</dd>
			<dt>Q.I. Roberts Middle School</dt>
			<dd>This was a very small school of around 300 students. One of the most growth filled periods of my life, I found a love for band here, but due to extremely low funding my only other choice of extracurricular was AG and I am not much for the country-lifestyle. The school was shortly changed into what is now known as the Cambridge Program of Putnam county.</dd>
			<dt>Interlachen High</dt>
			<dd>I would graduate from this school as well as establish my most important hobbies and friends. This school was also small, having only around 700 students total and 130 in my graduating class. I discovered where I want to go and what I want to do in life. We were also the rams.</dd>
			<dt>Saint John's River State College</dt>
			<dd>I spent two semesters dual enrolling here my senior year of high school. Compared to Santa Fe this school was even smaller, often having class sizes of less than 20 students. St. John's most certainly helped me prepare for a successful college career.</dd>
			<dt>Santa Fe College</dt>
			<dd>As you may have ascertained by now, I am a student at SF. I am nearing the end of my second semester of my freshman year and I couldn't be happier. The classes here are wonderful and I am learning so much about computer science.</dd>
		</dl>
		<h2>Extracurriculars</h2>
    	<p>During my high school career I spent a good deal of time participating in extracurricular activities such as:</p>
    	<dl class="margins-removed">
    		<dt>Band</dt>
    		<dd>Music became a very close love of mine and I participated in every music related class that fit my schedule. There was one Chorus class and three Band classes which were:<br>
    			<ul>
    				<li>Marching Band</li>
    				<li>Symphonic Band</li>
    				<li>Jazz Band</li>
    			</ul></dd>
    		<dt>High Q</dt>
    		<dd>This was the academic team for our school. We participated against several groups our size from other counties. I was the team captain of JV my sophomore year as well as co-captain of Varsity my junior year.
    		<dt>Weightlifting</dt>
    		<dd>Originally I took the weightlifting class to satisfy my P.E. credit for graduating, but I later found something that I really enjoyed and so later in the year I joined the team.</dd>
    		<dt>Tennis</dt>
    		<dd>I wanted to play a sport my senior year and tennis seemed the easiest to join. I eventually made it to 5th seed beating out some people who had been seeded the year before.</dd>
